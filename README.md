# cpp_stl_parts
# Description

Repo with implementation of the most important containers / objects i(and a little bit other things) n C++ Standart Library. All these things were given to me as homework for 1-2 semesters of the subject "Programming in C++" (2020/2021) at MIPT, which I graduated with honors.

# Content (in descending order of writing time)

- std::function -  memory-friendly and fast polymorphic function wrapper
- std::unordered_map based on open hashing method on custom list. Full support of move-semantics is built-in.
- std::list and faster-then-default allocator for it with move-semantics and exception-awareness
- std::deque with exception-awareness
- Geometry primitives classes
- BigInteger class for long arithmetics with Rational class extension
- simple std::string implementation

In branches you can find code and technical specification for each task.
